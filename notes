brief: make a morse code converter

flow:

    1. could make a dictionary which will have the letters as the key and the morse as the value
        morse_code = {'A':'..', etc}

    2. ask user if they want to input:

        if yes -> prompt them to new input where they can type their sentence

        if no -> exit
